# Microserve Flexbox Grid Example

### [View Demo](https://microserve-io.github.io/ms-grid/)

---

There is an example for a fixed px gutter width and one with a
percentage gutter width. The fixed one is the default in the MS theme.

The only differences with the examples are the include grid scss.

The fluid grid uses: [/src/_grid-fluid.scss](https://github.com/microserve-io/ms-grid/blob/master/src/_grid-fluid.scss)

The fixed grid uses: [/src/_grid.scss](https://github.com/microserve-io/ms-grid/blob/master/src/_grid.scss)
